			 <h1 id="beets1">Sidebar Facts About Me</h1>
			 <p>I love playing and studying baseball, spending time with my girlfriend and family, and learning how to play piano. Also, I have learned to cook more foods at home, which I find a fun activity to do as well. I was born and raised in Santa Cruz, California with my sister, my mom, and my dad. I went to high school in San Jose, California at Archbishop Mitty where I set out to get a baseball scholarship. Other baseball goals I have reached are making the USA Baseball Northern California Team three times, and playing in Arizona as an Under Armor All-American. I eventually landed myself a scholarship at Cal State Monterey Bay, where I intend to play my first collegate season this upcoming year. Some things I picked up during quarentine are cooking and piano. Right before the pandemic hit, I had growing intrest in learning how to play the piano and would read up about it during my lunch breaks. When we were sent home, I thought it would be a good idea to start learning now, which I did. As for cooking, my girlfriend got me to start cooking more and more things. From burgers and steaks to rice and guacamole, I think I have learned to become a better chef.</p>

			<h2 id="beets2">Challenges</h2>
			<p>We are set out to challenge our CSS Skills with new border techniques. We are tasked to make a sidenbar as well as adding a few links at the top of our page.</p>
			<h3 id="beets3">Problems</h3>
			<p>We had quite a bit of problems on this lab. First, we couldn't figure out how to use the sticky feature, and had a hard time getting the links to show up at the top of the page. Overall, we had to do some research looking at the code from Wes'examples to help guide us to getting it right.</p>
			<h4 id="beets4">Results</h4>
			<p>After the lab, we have a working site with a sidebar on the right and two working links to the homepage and the CSS at the top. We added colors, borders, and different color texts as well.</p>
