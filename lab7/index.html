		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>Some challenges we faced came when savinf our work on the ccs folder. Usually, we only have to only save the index file. Also, we had some trouble keeping track of the different styles we were able to play around with.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We had a hard time finding where exactly to put the different styles and colors in our css file code. Also, we had a hard time figuring out where to put the css id and correlating it with the content in the index file.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The webpage I have created has a dark red border, a white background color, and matching dark red text with a new font. At the bottom, I added a picture of a nice resturant to match the overall asthetic of the site.</p>
