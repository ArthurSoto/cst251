			<h1 id="goldone">Challenges</h1>
			<p>This lab we set out to continue our HTML skills.</p>
			<h2 id="goldtwo">Problems</h2>
			<p>This lab wasn't very smooth at all. We tried to add a center aligned text but couldn't get it to work properly. Also, we tried to add photos as our borders and eventually got it to work after a long research. I had a couple isses taking fonts of Google fonts but was able to successfully add the links to my HTML.</p>
			<h3 id="goldthree">Results</h3>
			<p>As a result, we had a website with more borders and colors. We were able to mess around with different fonts and eventually add ones we like.</p>
