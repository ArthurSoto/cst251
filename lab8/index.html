		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p1 id="red-one">The challenges we faced were added selectors that we hadn't already used in past labs. Most of the styles we had tried in earlier labs, however, changing styles within styles was a new challenge we had to conquer.</p1>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p2 id="red-two">Some problems we had along the way came when trying to style the text different colors for different paragraphs. Also, we had a hard time finding the right code to make the image change size when the user hovers over it.</p2>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p3 id="red-three">We now have a webpage with styles within styles- the paragraphs have different fonts and colors at the same time. Also, I have made an image with the ability to shrink when the user hovers over it.</p3>
