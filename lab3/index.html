	<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h>
	<p>This labs purpose was to create a file structure that seperated each of our labs and the content within them. Also, we learned how to add a link to another HTML in our files on our own browser.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h>
	<p>The problem we had creating our HTML came with the pictures. We were able to get the picture to show on our browser, however, we had a difficult time fixing the size of the photos to fit  our browser like we wanted.</p>
	<h3>Results</h>
	<p>After we worked on creating an HTML, the webiste seen on the browser is our final product.</p>
