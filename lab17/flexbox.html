			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>This lab, we were set out to change the alignment of the content of our page, and move them around the page in our prefferred arangement.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I faced many problems throughout this lab. The first major problem I encountered was trying to get the content to align correctly. First off, I forgot to link my CSS to my HTML, which I found frusterating because nothing was working up until it was fixed. The float was giving me some troubles as well, and I had to move some things around to fix it. I also had a hard time getting my images into links, but it was a simple fix. Overall, this lab was very difficult and at times it felt like I was hitting a CSS wall.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>My website now has a header on the right, links on the top, images on the right, and a footer down below. I have working links that take the user to images, and links that lead back to the homepage and css.</p>
