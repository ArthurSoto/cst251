			<h1 id="phone1">Challenges</h1>
			<p>We were set out to recreate a website of our choosing in a more complicated manner than our last lab.</p>
			<h2 id="phone2">Problems</h2>
			<p>We had many problems during this lab making it the new toughest lab yet. The major problem we had was finding a way to add text on top of an imported image. We had a hard time figureing out the sizing as well as the placement of the text, which caused many issues. In the end, we weere able to add text on top of the photo but could not find out how to add bigger and broader paragraphs.</p>
			<h3 id="phone3">Results</h3>
			<p>As a result, I have a working website with an image as the main piece. There is a link to the about tab in the upper right hand corner, linking to our Lab 2 which detailed some facts aboit myself. Also, I have text over lapping the image, and a link to the home page and css's on the main html.</p>
