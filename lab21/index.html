			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>This lab was assigned to llow us to flesh out some of pur ideas we discussed this week with our groups. We split the pages we liked amoungst our group, and I was assigned to design the "free-roam" page.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Some issues I had was finding ways to fill the page completely. I wanted to make the page very interactive, but I found it difficult to narrow down what info was needed and what was not.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>I have made three concept drawings for the webpage I was assigned by my group. The page ill be interactive and have hyperlinks to plenty of different sites and images.</p>
