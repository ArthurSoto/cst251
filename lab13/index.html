			<h1 id="phone1">Challenges</h1>
			<p>This lab we were tasked to recreate a website of our choice in our fake html and css without using the exact code of the original webiste.</p>
			<h2 id="phone2">Problems</h2>
			<p>Some problems we had along the road came when trying to cener our text in the middle of the entire page. Eventually, we did some research and figured out of to use the margin top to push our text down the page and into the center. Also, it was hard to find a font familt that exactly matched the text on our website we tried to copy.</p>
			<h3 id="phone3">Results</h3>
			<p>After completing the lab, I have a website that has matching colors and text to my samle website. The text is aligned in the exact center of the page, and I added a background image to my site for the first time ever.</p>
