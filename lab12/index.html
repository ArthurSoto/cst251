			<p>This lab is our most challenging lan yet. We were set out to learn how to use the float tool. This way, we are going to be able to move text around the page where we want it.</p>
			<h2 id="beets3">Problems</h2>
			<p>We ran into a lot of problem across this lab. We had a hard time figuring out where to position the text and our div id's which started the lab off to a rocky start. Then, we couldn't figure out the floating process in our CSS, which led to an extensive trail and error process. Then, we forgot to add divs in some places, so that also sent our html into a frenzy.  But overall, we were able to get it to work.</p>
			<h3 id="beets4">Results</h3>
			<p>We now have a site that has text floated in the center and the right, as well as an image floated in the middle. Also, we have a back button leading to our homepage.</p>
