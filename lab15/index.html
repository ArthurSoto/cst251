			<h1 id="phone1">Challenges</h1>
			<p1 id="case1">This lab was pretty open-ended. We were tasked to use new styling skills that were more fancy to us.</p1>
			<h2 id="phone2">Problems</h2>
			<p2 id="case2">I had little to no problems during this lab. I was able to easily add a link to the home page and CSS, a gradient on the body, and shadow box and text with no problems. The only issue I had was trying to place an image inside of the text of the body, but it was a small issue. I was also able to add a background image with no problems, which that was osmething I had a hard time with before.</p2>
			<h3 id="phone3">Results</h3>
			<p3 id="case3">After the lab, I have a more advanced and stylish webpage with gradients, slants, and shadows across the whole page. Overall, this lab went very smoothly for me, and I was able to take a step forward in my CSS skills.</p3>
